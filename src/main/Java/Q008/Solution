Code Explanation:

String[][] arr = {{"A", "B", "C"}, {"D", "E"}};
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
        System.out.print(arr[i][j] + " ");
        if (arr[i][j].equals("B")) {
            continue;
        }
    }
    continue;
}


The array arr is a 2D array with two rows:

arr[0] = {"A", "B", "C"}
arr[1] = {"D", "E"}
The outer for loop iterates through the rows of the array (arr.length is 2).

The inner for loop iterates through each element in a row.

Inside the inner loop:

The System.out.print(arr[i][j] + " ") prints each element followed by a space.
The if statement checks if the current element is "B".
If so, it uses the continue statement to skip the rest of the current iteration
(but this does not affect the outer loop).

Output:
On the first iteration of the outer loop (i = 0), the inner loop iterates through {"A", "B", "C"}:

A is printed.
B is printed, then continue is hit, skipping any further code for B.
C is printed.
On the second iteration of the outer loop (i = 1), the inner loop iterates through {"D", "E"}:

D is printed.
E is printed.
Thus, the output will be:

A B C D E

Correct Answer:
B. A B C D E
